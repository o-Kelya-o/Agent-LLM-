To ensure this works, setup a .env file like this ->
'''
GEMINI_API_KEY="<your gemini_api_key>"
WORKING_DIR="<your working directory for a base (so the ai won't modify or access anny other files that are not in the working_dir)>"
'''
(oh, and make sure to not use this btw, this is not secured at all the ai (with a little bypass) could easily modify or access any other file in your system. This is just a personal project)
